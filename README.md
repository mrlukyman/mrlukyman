- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mrlukyman

I am  a computer science student always exploring new technologies and possibilities.
On my profile you can find my school work as well as projects I've been working on during my free time.
I am currently learning Solidity and web3.js and trying out GraphQL with express, prisma and apollo server as well.
